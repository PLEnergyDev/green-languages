description: |
    Consider for a given M the problem of finding the least integer n such that 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n >= M.
    For M = 20 the answer is n = 272400600 and the loop performs that many iterations.
    Each iteration involves a floating-point comparison, a floating-point division and a floating-point addition, as well as an integer increment.

            int m = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

            int n = 0;
            while (sum < m) {
                n++;
                sum += 1.0 / n;
            }
            System.out.printf("%d\n", n);
